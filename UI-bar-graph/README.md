# UI-bar-graph exercise

## Instructions

- Using any UI framework (or none) create a bar graph using the data.json file provided using javascript and css
- Do not use any third party graph libraries, the graph should be your own
- After you complete the exercise, provide notes below on how your code can be ran whether it be by simply opening a index.html file or through an npm command

## Candidate Notes:
- For this I also created an html file that draws the bars on load, barGraph.html.
- Simply open it in a browser and you will see the bars.
- Ideally I would put a black border around each rectangle.  
- Of course there is also the matter of putting data on the sides and bottom of the graph, 
- but time was limited.
